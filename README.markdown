MQTT to KVPUBSUB Router
=======================
Toby Jaffey <toby@sensemote.com>

This is a router to convert between MQTT's pubsub semantics and a 1:N unicast
protocol.

The 1-N unicast protocol is a line oriented, text based protocol called
KVPUBSUB. In KVPUBSUB, there are 3 commands from client to server (PUB, SUB,
UNSUB) and 4 responses from server to client (PUBACK, SUBACK, UNSUBACK, INF).

The router was originally designed to help with connecting RS232 radio modems
(ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc) to MQTT. Though, it can also be used from the command
line directly.


Quickstart
----------

Build it

    sudo apt-get install libev-dev libmosquitto0-dev
    cmake .
    make

Cross-build for armhf platform

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libc6-armhf-cross libc6-dev-armhf-cross
    sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
    sudo apt-get install libev-dev:armhf libmosquitto-dev:armhf
    cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake_toolchains/ubuntu-armhf.cmake
    make

Connect to console and MQTT broker, subscribe two clients to a topic

    ./router -v -d - -s test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t prefix/

    SUB alice power id
    SUB bob power id

Publish data to the broker and see it routed to the clients

    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t "prefix/power" -m "1.21GW"

You will see

    INF alice power 1.21GW  
    INF bob power 1.21GW  


A simple publish example
------------------------

An energy monitor with address 0xCAFE reports power data to a radio gateway.
The gateway is connected via a serial line to the router.

A web service is subscribed to the MQTT topic PREFIX/power

* Energy monitor reports power of 69W to gateway
* Gateway writes "PUB 0xCAFE power 69W forgetmenot" to the router
* Router publishes "power" = "69W" to MQTT broker
* Router receives publish acknowledgement from MQTT broker
* Router writes "PUBACK 0xCAFE forgetmenot" back to gateway

The serial line between gateway and router sees:

    -> PUB 0xCAFE power 69W forgetmenot  
    <- PUBACK 0xCAFE forgetmenot  

All subscribed clients of the MQTT broker see "69W" on PREFIX/power.

A simple subscribe example
--------------------------

    -> SUB alice power token  
    <- SUBACK alice token  
    -> SUB bob power token  
    <- SUBACK bob token  
    -> PUB carol power 1.21GW token  
    <- PUBACK carol token  
    -> INF alice power 1.21GW  
    -> INF bob power 1.21GW  

Now, a publish to the MQTT topic PREFIX/power will result in INF messages to
both alice and bob.


Commands
========

A client of the router (eg. a wireless gateway) sends commands to the router
and receives responses. Responses are asynchronous and may arrive out of order.
The INF message may arrive at the client at any time.

    Cmd: PUB addr key val id
    Rsp: PUBACK addr id

    Cmd: SUB addr key id
    Rsp: SUBACK addr id

    Cmd: UNSUB addr key id
    Rsp: UNSUBACK addr id

    Rsp: INF addr key val

Format
======

All commands are single lines of "\r\n" terminated ASCII text with arguments
separated by spaces.

Addresses, keys, values and ids are all freeform strings.

The following escape sequences are accepted:

    '\ ' -> ' '
    '\n' -> newline
    '\r' -> CR
    '"'  -> "
    '\\' -> '\'

Eg. to publish data containing spaces:

    PUB myaddr mykey This\ is\ all\ one\ argument myid


Caveats
=======

The router doesn't yet support MQTT wildcards, using # and + in key names will
likely cause problems.

The data structures used for internal dispatch of INF will not scale well to thousands of clients.

Subscriptions never timeout.
